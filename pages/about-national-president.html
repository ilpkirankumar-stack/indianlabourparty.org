                <h6>Founder & National President Of Indian Labour Party (Ambedkar, Phule)</h6>
                <p>I was born in 1955 in Lingaraopalem, a small village about 30 km from Guntur, Andhra Pradesh, during the lifetime of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar. My parents were illiterate agricultural laborers, and our family lived in abject poverty. We stayed in a thatched house with mud walls and a hay roof. I completed my primary education at the Roman Catholic Mission (RCM) elementary school in our colony.</p>

        <h5>Education Journey</h5>
        <p>With the encouragement of our neighbor, Sri Aseervadam (late), a government school teacher, I joined Annaparru ZP High School and stayed in a private hostel run by a philanthropist. I completed my SSC there. As a member of a Scheduled Caste, I faced discrimination and hunger during my early schooling. Despite these hardships, I pursued higher education at Andhra Christian College in Guntur, staying in a Government Social Welfare Hostel meant for weaker sections.</p><br />
        <p>I later pursued M.Sc. in Mathematics from Acharya Nagarjuna University and was the athletic champion of the University College in 1977–78. I also excelled in athletics, especially Pole Vault, during my B.Ed. at A.L. College of Education, Guntur.</p>

        <h5>Professional Career in Banking</h5>
        <p>On January 5, 1981, I joined Indian Overseas Bank through the Banking Service Recruitment Board (BSRB). This opportunity came after the nationalization of banks in 1969 by Prime Minister Smt. Indira Gandhi, which significantly improved access for SC/ST candidates through proper implementation of reservations.</p><br />
        <p>While still in bank service, I completed a Law Degree in 1998. After retirement, I began legal practice in 2001 to remain closely connected to the Scheduled Caste community. Alongside my legal work, I completed an M.A. in Political Science from Siddhartha College, Vijayawada.</p>

        <h5>Activism and Advocacy in Banking Sector</h5>
        <p>Caste discrimination existed not just in villages, but also within banks and government offices. The leadership was often dominated by upper castes, making it difficult for Scheduled Castes to receive justice. I served as the <b class="pbold">All India Vice-President of the Indian Overseas Bank SC/ST Employees Welfare Association</b>, advocating for the rights and welfare of SC/ST employees. In 2001, I took <b class="pbold">Voluntary Retirement (VRS)</b> to dedicate myself fully to the cause of social justice.</p>

        <h5>Doctoral Research and Academic Contributions</h5>
        <p>In 2005, I enrolled for a Ph.D. under the Dr. Ambedkar Chair at Acharya Nagarjuna University. My research focused on "The Status of Scheduled Castes in Andhra Pradesh", and I was awarded the Ph.D. degree in 2010. I have presented papers in numerous national seminars and also at an international conference in 2015 held in Washington D.C., USA.</p>

        <h5>Ideological Inspiration and Political Beliefs</h5>
        <p>Dr. B.R. Ambedkar believed that caste is the root cause of India’s social and economic problems, and that political power is the key to change. Kanshiram also echoed that "Political Power is the Master Key." Unfortunately, current reservation policies under a joint electorate system prevent true representation of SC/ST communities, as elected members are often more loyal to their political parties than to their own people.</p>

        <h5>Founding of Indian Labour Party (Ambedkar, Phule)</h5>
        <p>Motivated by these principles, I co-founded the Indian Labour Party (Ambedkar Phule) in 2010 to empower the weaker sections, particularly Scheduled Castes. The party is registered with the Election Commission of India and has been fielding candidates in every election since its inception. I serve as the Founder President of the party.</p><br />
        <p>No movement or mission is possible without the unwavering support of one’s life partner. I acknowledge the vital role my wife has played in my journey—both personal and political.</p>

        <h5>Knowledge Foreign Trips</h5>
        <p>I have toured in the 2013 along with my wife visited the countries Israel, Palestine, Jordon, Egypt and Dubai for about 11 days from 7th, May 2013 as a first trip. In the second occasion I along with my wife visited the countries Johannesburg in South Africa, where my son Kiran Kumar and his wife have been working and also the important cities visited such as Durban Sea coast, Pretoria and Cape-Town the capital of South Africa are the principal cities in South Africa. Fortunately I was physically present when Nelson Mandela, the father of Southa Africa died and where his body be laid to rest in his home in Qunu in South Africa on 15-12-2013.</p><br />
        <p>Since long time I had an ambition to visit London where Dr. B.R.Ambedkar had studied and obtained Doctor of Economics in London School of Economics and Bar-at-law I had an occasion to visit London, Britan on 30-10-2014 as a third trip to tour European Countries like France, Switzerland, Italy, Austria and Germany. fourthly there was a Global Conference convened on defending on Dalit Rights held at Washington D.C., USA from 19th to 21st March 2015 for which P. Sam Prasad, General Secretary and I, the President were being invited as delegates on behalf of the Indian Labour Party (Ambedkar Phule). I spoke on the subject of Dalit Rights on 20th March, 2015. Lastly I visited the South East Asian Countries Such as Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand which are mostly the Buddhist Countries for period of 13 days from 12th October 2017. What I am today is because of Dr. B.R.Ambedkar and as I am inspired by his intellectual personality and attracted to his philosophy and follower of Dr. B.R.Ambedkar.</p>
